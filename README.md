## Project Setup

## Project Management
GitHub's KanBan board to manage my workflow. [](https://github.com/)
* Three columns:
    - todo
    - in progress
    - done

The board allowed me to easily drag my stories through the business delivery lifecycle of: To Do -> In Progress -> Completed.

## Features

    Import:
        - datetime
        - pandas as pd
        - start = datetime.datetime.strptime("01-12-2021", "%d-%m-%Y")
        - end = datetime.datetime.strptime("07-12-2021", "%d-%m-%Y")
        - date_generated = pd.date_range(start, end)
            - Greatings according to season:
            - if September f"Back to School!"
            - elif December f"Happy Christmas!!!"
            - elif February f"Happy Valentine`s Day!"
            - elif March/april f"Happy Easter!"
            - elif August f"Sale! 10% off with any purchase!"
            - else f"delivery free with purchase of {{ FRE_DELIVERY_TRESHOLD}}â‚¬!"
